# Discuss-it 
#### Online article discussion tracker

## Version 1.0

[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/theoretick/discuss-it.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/theoretick/discuss-it)

Website for locating online discussions about a given article.

Currently hosted at: [discuss-it.herokuapp.com](https://discuss-it.herokuapp.com/)

## Features

Version 1.0 of Discuss-it takes a URL of an interesting site which you think may have interesting discussion somewhere on the internet and queries the search functions of link aggregators with comment systems.

After submitting your URL we return a page with links. The links we return take you directly to the comments page of the article in question so that you can begin talking about the link you searched for immediately.

Current list of queried sites:
* __Hacker News__
* __Reddit__

The returned search results include the top search result as sorted by upvotes/points for each queried site followed by a list of all returned results below it ordered by the same criteria.
